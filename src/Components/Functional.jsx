                <p>Functional components are some of the more common components that will come across
                    while working in React. These are simply JavaScript functions. We can create a
                    functional component to React by writing a JavaScript function. These functions may
                    or may not receive data as parameters. In the functional Components, the return value
                    is the JSX code to render to the DOM tree.</p>
